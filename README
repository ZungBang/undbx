*[http://code.google.com/p/undbx/ UnDBX]* -
Tool to extract e-mail messages from Outlook Express `.dbx` files. 

Copyright (C) 2008 Avi Rozen <avi.rozen@gmail.com>

==DOWNLOAD==
Windows binary and source code archives are available at
http://code.google.com/p/undbx/downloads/list
together with corresponding `md5sum` digests, which you can use to verify
each archive's integrity.

==INSTALLATION==
There's no installer or setup program. Simply extract the distribution `.zip`
file to some folder. 

==USAGE==
Run the following command in a command ("DOS") shell, to extract e-mail
messages from all the `.dbx` files in `<DBX-DIRECTORY>` to corresponding
sub-directories in `<OUTPUT-DIRECTORY>`: 

{{{
undbx <DBX-DIRECTORY> <OUTPUT-DIRECTORY>
}}}

Alternatively, you may simply double-click `undbx-launcher.vbs`, which should
have been extracted along side `undbx.exe`. You'll be presented twice with a
standard folder selection dialog in order to select both the input and output
folders, and then `undbx.exe` will be launched on your behalf inside a console
window. 


==OPERATION==
On first invocation all messages will be extracted as individual `.eml`
files. Subsequent invocations will only _update_ the output directory.
Any `.eml` files that do not correspond to messages in the `.dbx` file will be
treated as deleted messages and will be deleted from the
disk. Furthermore, only new messages, that do not correspond to files
on disk, will be extracted from the `.dbx` file.

*UnDBX* was written to facilitate _fast_ incremental backup of `.dbx`
 files.
