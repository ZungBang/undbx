INSTALLATION
============
There's no installer or setup program. Simply extract undbx.exe from
the ZIP file to some directory and run it from there.

USAGE
=====
Run the following command in a command ("DOS") shell, to extract e-mail
messages from all the DBX files in <DBX-DIRECTORY> to a corresponding
sub-directory in <OUTPUT-DIRECTORY>: 

undbx <DBX-DIRECTORY> <OUTPUT-DIRECTORY>

OPERATION
=========
On first invocation all messages will be extracted as individual EML
files. Subsequent invocations will only _update_ the output directory:
EML files that do not correspond to messages in the DBX file will be
treated as deleted messages and will be deleted from the
disk. Furthermore, only new messages, that do not correspond to files
on disk, will be extracted from the DBX file.
