*[http://code.google.com/p/undbx/ UnDBX]* -
Tool to extract e-mail messages from Outlook Express `.dbx` files. 

Copyright (C) 2008 Avi Rozen <avi.rozen@gmail.com>

==INSTALLATION==
There's no installer or setup program. Simply extract `undbx.exe` from
the distribution `.zip` file to some directory and run it from there.

==USAGE==
Run the following command in a command ("DOS") shell, to extract e-mail
messages from all the `.dbx` files in `<DBX-DIRECTORY>` to a corresponding
sub-directory in `<OUTPUT-DIRECTORY>`: 

{{{
undbx <DBX-DIRECTORY> <OUTPUT-DIRECTORY>
}}}

==OPERATION==
On first invocation all messages will be extracted as individual `.eml`
files. Subsequent invocations will only _update_ the output directory:
`.eml` files that do not correspond to messages in the `.dbx` file will be
treated as deleted messages and will be deleted from the
disk. Furthermore, only new messages, that do not correspond to files
on disk, will be extracted from the `.dbx` file.

*UnDBX* was written to facilitate _fast_ incremental backup of `.dbx`
 files.  

==SOURCE CODE==

===REPOSITORY===
*UnDBX* source code can be downloaded and/or cloned from its public Git
repository at
http://github.com/ZungBang/undbx/tree

===COMPILING===
I compile the code with the MinGW cross compiler on a Debian
GNU/Linux box. To compile this on Microsoft Windows you'll need to
install MinGW from http://www.mingw.org and tweak the
`Makefile`. Please send a patch if you care enough. 

==BUGS==
Please report problems via the *UnDBX* issue tracking system:
